Black box Testing – BVA & ECP 
2.1 Determine ECP & BVA 

1. ‘X’ has given a data on a person age which should be between 18 and 99. Using BVA, find appropriate test cases. 

equivalence class1 [<18]  
equivalence class2 [>=18 and <=99]  
equivalence class3 [>99]  
boundary value for equivalence partition class1 17 and 18 
boundary value for equivalence partition class2 18,19,98,99  
boundary value for equivalence partition class3 99 and 100  

2. In an Examination, a candidate has to score a minimum of 60 marks in order to clear the exam. 
The maximum that he can score is 100 marks.  Identify the Valid Equivalence values if the student clears the exam. 
  
equivalence class1 [>=60 and <=100] 

3. Consider a scenario where a ‘Driver on Hire’ agency provides most reliable and affordable drivers on hire.
The monthly salary structure configured for the drivers of this agency is : drivers up to 25 years old get a pay of Rs. 15000/- ; 
drivers of age 65 and older get a pay of 5% more  and drivers of age 40 and older get a pay of 10% more than that of the drivers up to 25 years get. How many equivalence classes are distinguished in the above? 
Also, which values are chosen for making test cases when the normal variant of the boundary values analysis is used? 

equivalence class1 [<=25]  
equivalence class2 [>=40 and <65]  
equivalence class3 [>=65]  
boundary value for equivalence partition class1 [24,25] 
boundary value for equivalence partition class2 [39,40,64,65,66] 

4. Consider a scenario where a ‘Winter Sale’ provides heavy discounts. A person he/she of age less than 8 years old (<8),
 or a person aged between 35 and 45 years (>35 and <45) or older than 60 years (>60) is eligible for the discounts in Winter Sale. 
How many equivalence classes can be distinguished in this example?  
 
equivalence class1 [<8]  
equivalence class2 [>35 and <45]  
equivalence class3 [>60]

5. A wholesaler sells printer cartridges. The minimum order quantity is 5. 
There is a 20% discount for orders of 100 or more printer cartridges.
Identify the test cases using various values for the number of printer cartridges ordered.

equivalence class1 [>=5 and <=99]  
equivalence class2 [>=100]  
boundary value for equivalence partition class1 [5,6,99,100,101] 

6. A company is going to provide their employees with a bonus which will be based on the employee’s length of service in the company. 
The bonus calculation will be zero if they have been with the company for less than two years, 10% of their salary for more than two but less than five years,
 and 25% for five to ten years, 35% for ten years or more. 
The interface will not allow a negative value to be input, but it will allow a zero to be input. 

equivalence class1 [<2]  
equivalence class2 [>=2 and <5]  
equivalence class3 [>=5 and <10]
equivalence class1 [>=10]  








How many equivalence partitions are needed to test the calculation of the bonus?
